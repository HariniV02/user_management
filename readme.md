# Issue 2: Profile Picture URL Validation

## Description
Implemented comprehensive checks to validate profile picture URLs. The validation ensures the URL is properly formatted, ends with standard image extensions like `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, or `.png`, and meets security requirements. Additional measures include verifying that the URL structure is correct and optionally confirming the resource is accessible and points to a valid image file.
