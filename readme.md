# Issue 5: Email Verification

## Description
The user verification email previously contained a `None` value for the User ID. This has been resolved, and the email is now triggered only once when the user is created or updated in the database.

**Note:** I accidentally switched the code for Error 1 and Error 5, so the branch names will not be the same as the actual issue fixed.
